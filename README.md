This repo contains the source for the **Twitter bot** which Tweet out the latest Ticket price after a fixed interval of time. 

All the bots are made with the help of [`tweepy`](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy) library for accessing the Twitter API, and [`CoinMarketCap`](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/) API for accessing the latest financial market data, and [`Railway`](https://railway.app/) for the deployment.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Prerequisite

- **Twitter Developer Account**
  - We need to get a developer account for getting private keys and secrets. You can apply from it [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info), it will take 5-10 min for setting up a Dev account.

- **CoinMaerketCap API Keys** (Optional if you don't need any financial market data)
  - We can use any financial market API for getting the latest quote of the assets, but here we are using the `CoinMarketCap API` free plan. You can get API access from [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/).

- **Railway Account**
  - For deploying and running we will use [Railway](https://railway.app/). Here we are using Railway because it's free and can run the bot for 24X7 without any refreshment.

## üñ±Ô∏è Using and quick set-up guide:

- Fork this repository
 
- Install all the dependencies from [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) file. We can also use the command to install all the dependencies at once.

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
```

- Create a `.env` file in the root folder and add in your API keys and like so :

```
Note: Here I have included 2 sets of keys, because I am running 2 different bots from the same repo, 
you can also use one of them, either BTC or Doge

BTC_CON_KEY = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX     (TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY)
BTC_CON_SECRET = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  (TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET)      
BTC_KEY = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX         (TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN)
BTC_SECRET = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX      (TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET)
BTC_COIN_KEY = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX    (CoinMarketCap API KEY)

DOGE_CON_KEY = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX      (TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY)
DOGE_CON_SECRET = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX   (TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET)
DOGE_KEY = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX          (TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN)
DOGE_SECRET = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX       (TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET)
DOGE_COIN_KEY = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX     (CoinMarketCap API KEY)
```

- Run `python3 doge.py` or `python3 btc.py`, depending on which bot you are running.
